## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **6th-year Ph.D. candidate** at *Columbia University*, advised by **Prof. Nima Mesgarani**.  
My research is dedicated to **transforming how people hear in complex acoustic environments**.

🧩 I develop **brain-controlled hearing systems** that decode neural signals in real time to determine which talker a listener is focused on — then **selectively amplify** that talker’s voice, enabling effortless communication in noisy, multi-talker settings.
